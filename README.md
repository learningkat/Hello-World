# Hello-World
my very first git

<p>This is the first step in a quest for me to get out of the restaurant industry.  I am taking some time to see if I enjoy learning, and could become skilled at, coding.</p>

<ul>
  <lh>Things I've done so far</lh>
  <li>created accounts with github and stack overflow</li>
  <li>ran through the basic html course at codeacademy</li>
  <li>gotten distracted a lot</li>
</ul>
