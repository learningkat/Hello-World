# Hello-World
my very first git

This is the first step in a quest for me to get out of the restaurant industry.  I am taking some time to see if I enjoy learning, and could become skilled at, coding.  

<ol>
  <lh>What I think my next steps are</lh>
  <li>Do little bits of freecodeacademy everyday.</li>
  <li>Figure out one new tech thing everyday, since I'm not in this world already I have a lot of very basic questions.  I've always been able to use computers but I have no idea how they <em>work</em>.</li>
  <li>Keep brainstorming ideas of projects.</li>
  <li>Decide whether to apply to the next cycle of academy</li>
</ol>
